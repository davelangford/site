        <p>You're not always easy to share space with.</p>
        <p>Some days you wake up ten times bigger than you are.</p>
        <p>I can't get my arms around you</p>
        <p>And we are silent worlds apart.</p>
        <p>Should I introduce myself?</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You don't seem to recognise me</p>
        <p>But you know... you look... just like someone</p>
        <p>That I used to know.</p>
        <p>(I'm pleased to meet you)</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You know I think you used to love me</p>
        <p>But now... it seems... like that was a whole lifetime ago.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>If you don't look at me do I disappear?</p>
        <p>And all you say these days are things I don't wanna hear.</p>
        <p>I don't think that you remember</p>
        <p>It was always you and me against the world.</p>
        <p>Should I introduce myself</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You don't seem to recognise me</p>
        <p>But you know... you look... just like someone</p>
        <p>That I used to know.</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You know I think you used to love me</p>
        <p>But now... it seems... like that was a whole lifetime ago.</p>
        <p>So I guess I'll see you round sometime</p>
        <p>And one day you might</p>
        <p>Think we've met before</p>
        <p>You'll turn to me and say,</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You don't seem to recognise me</p>
        <p>But you know... you look... just like someone that I used to knowâ€¦</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You know I think you used to love me</p>
        <p>But now... it seems... like that was a whole lifetime ago.</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to meet you</p>
        <p>You know I think you used to love me</p>
